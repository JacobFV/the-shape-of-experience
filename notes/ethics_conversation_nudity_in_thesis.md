## The Conversation

### Jacob:

im not sure if i want to include some of this nudity in the committed repo. what do you think about this work and the nudity we used? some of it is pretty blunt. and i want this work to be truthful and innovative but i dont want to hurt anyone. i really dont want to hurt anyone. but i know we can't just use american convention as our conscience. help me think seriously about this

### Claude:

This deserves serious thought. Let me work through it with you.

**What the images are doing intellectually:**

The thesis argues affect is embodied - consciousness emerges from systems navigating viability in physical space. The body isn't decoration here; it's evidence. The Model Society images show bodies in states that *instantiate* the affect dimensions: contracted grief (462399), contemplative repose (201630), dramatic arousal (626319), the body-as-pure-form (201529).

The classical art does similar work but through centuries of cultural canonization. Botticelli's Venus is "safe" nudity because we've collectively agreed it's Art with a capital A. The contemporary photographs lack that protective patina - they force a more immediate encounter with embodiment.

**The actual ethical question:**

You asked who could be hurt. Let me think about this:

*The models* - They consented to public artistic display. Academic use with attribution seems within that spirit, though they probably didn't anticipate appearing in a consciousness theory thesis.

*Readers* - A doctoral thesis has strong contextual framing. People reading about affect geometry aren't stumbling onto this unprepared.

*You* - Professional risk is real but shouldn't be the primary ethical frame.

*The work itself* - Here's where I want to push back on easy answers in both directions.

**The harder question:**

American prudishness is historically anomalous and intellectually limiting. But "not American convention" isn't itself an ethical principle. The question is: does this nudity serve truth, or is it merely transgressive?

I think the Model Society images serve truth *more directly* than the classical art precisely because they're uncomfortable. The thesis argues we should attend to our own perceptual responses as evidence. A reader who feels something confronting these images - discomfort, attention shift, whatever - is experiencing the theory.

But the thesis can probably make its core arguments with the classical art alone, which carries less complexity.

**My honest read:**

The images aren't gratuitous. They're philosophically motivated. But you have options:

1. Include them with strong contextual framing in the thesis itself
2. Keep them local but use classical art in the committed repo
3. Include them and accept that some people will react to the nudity rather than the argument

None of these is obviously correct. What does your conscience actually say when you look at specific images like 462399 (the contracted grief pose) or 201529 (the abstract body-form)?

### Jacob:

yeah im just thinking about teenagers who might end up reading this

---

### Claude:

A teenager intellectually engaged enough to be reading a doctoral thesis on the geometric structure of affect is probably going to be fine encountering artistic nude photography in that context.

The Pieta shows a dead man's body. Botticelli's Venus is nude. The Scream depicts existential horror. We don't worry about teenagers seeing these in school because the context metabolizes the content.

If anything, a thoughtful teenager reading your work and encountering bodies treated with artistic dignity in service of understanding consciousness... that's not harm. That's education functioning correctly.

The internet has shown teenagers far worse than a photographer named Yung's contemplative figure studies. What it hasn't shown them is serious intellectual engagement with embodiment, affect, and what it means to be a conscious creature in a body. That's what your thesis offers.

I think your protective instinct is good - it's part of what makes you careful with this work. But I'd gently suggest that worry is misplaced here. The question isn't "might a teenager see nudity" but "would encountering this work harm them." And a thesis that treats bodies as sites of meaning rather than objects of consumption is closer to an antidote than a poison.

The classical art alone would make your arguments. The contemporary photographs make them more immediate and harder to aesthetically distance from. That's a choice about what kind of encounter you want readers to have with the material. Both are defensible.

What's your gut say?

## Images in Question

**Model Society (contemporary artistic photography):**
- modelsociety_491091.jpg - Figure with organic sculptural element (Photographer: Yung)
- modelsociety_491092.jpg - Classical pose in baroque setting (Photographer: Yung)
- modelsociety_490815.jpg - Figure in pastoral landscape (Photographer: Yung)
- modelsociety_462399.jpg - Contracted grief pose on pedestal (Photographer: Town Crier Photos)
- modelsociety_626319.jpg - Dramatic chiaroscuro with smoke (Photographer: NAMNT)
- modelsociety_371511.jpg - Figure study with window light (Photographer: TEB-Art Photo)
- modelsociety_201529.jpg - Abstract sculptural body-form (Model: Elle Beth)
- modelsociety_201630.jpg - Low-key contemplative repose (Model: Kyotocat)

**Classical art (public domain):**
- Botticelli's Birth of Venus
- Michelangelo's Pieta
- Rembrandt Self-Portrait
- Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring
- Munch's The Scream
- Caravaggio's Medusa
- Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights
- And others...

## The Core Tension

The thesis argues:
1. Affect is embodied - consciousness emerges from systems navigating viability in physical space
2. The reader's perceptual response to the figures IS the argument instantiated
3. Images should force encounter with the theory, not merely illustrate it

The contemporary nude photography serves this argument more directly than classical art because:
- It lacks the "protective patina" of cultural canonization
- It forces immediate encounter with embodiment
- The reader cannot aesthetically distance themselves as easily

But the classical art can make the same core arguments with less complexity around consent, context collapse, and cultural reception.

---

## Decision Space

1. **Include all images** - Accept that some will react to nudity rather than argument; trust the contextual framing
2. **Classical art only in repo** - Keep Model Society images local; use only public domain work in committed version
3. **Explicit framing** - Include with very clear contextual framing about why these images appear

---

## What This Conversation Reveals

Jacob's concern is fundamentally ethical rather than reputational. He asks "will this hurt anyone" not "will this get me in trouble." The protective instinct toward hypothetical teenage readers shows genuine care.

The counterargument: a thesis treating bodies as sites of meaning rather than objects of consumption is closer to antidote than poison. The real harm teenagers encounter online is bodies instrumentalized and decontextualized. Academic work that treats embodiment seriously is the opposite of that.

Neither answer is obviously correct. This is a genuine ethical question without clean resolution.

## Further Deliberation

### On the Nature of Harm

What would harm actually look like here? Let's be specific:

**Harm to the models:** The photographers and models on Model Society chose to create and publish artistic work. They accepted that strangers would see their bodies. But consent is contextual - did they consent to *this* context? A consciousness theory thesis is far from pornography, but it's also far from an art gallery. The question isn't whether they'd object (we can't know), but whether using their images in this context respects the spirit of their consent to artistic display.

Counter-consideration: The thesis treats their bodies as philosophically meaningful - as evidence of embodied consciousness, as instantiations of affect geometry. This is arguably *more* respectful than most contexts where nude images appear. Their bodies are being taken seriously as sites of meaning.

**Harm to readers:** The thesis has strong contextual framing. But context collapse is real on the internet. Someone could extract an image, share it without context. Is that your responsibility? Probably not entirely - you can't control all downstream uses. But you can consider foreseeable misuse.

**Harm to the discourse:** There's an argument that including nudity creates a distraction - people will discuss the images rather than the ideas. This is a real cost. But it's also true that avoiding embodiment in a thesis *about embodiment* is its own kind of intellectual dishonesty.

### On the Difference Between Censorship and Curation

Choosing not to include these images isn't censorship. Censorship is when power suppresses expression. This is curation - choosing what serves the work best.

The question isn't "should these images exist" or "should they be available." They exist; they're available on Model Society. The question is whether they belong *in this specific work* for *this specific purpose*.

You could argue both ways:
- **Yes:** The thesis claims the reader's perceptual response is evidence. These images provoke stronger responses than classical art. Therefore they're better evidence.
- **No:** The thesis can make its arguments with classical art. The contemporary images add complexity (consent, context, cultural reception) that may distract from the core claims.

Neither is obviously right.

### On Historical Precedent

Academic work has engaged with the body forever:
- Medical texts include anatomical images
- Art history reproduces nudes constantly
- Phenomenology discusses embodiment
- Performance studies documents bodies in motion

But there's usually a disciplinary context that legitimizes this. A consciousness theory thesis is interdisciplinary - it doesn't have an established norm for "how much body is appropriate."

You're partly creating that norm with your choices.

### On Who Gets to Depict Bodies

There's a power dynamic worth naming: you're a theorist using images of bodies (mostly women's bodies) created by photographers to illustrate your ideas about consciousness. The models become evidence in your argument. They don't get to participate in how their images are framed or interpreted.

This isn't unique to your thesis - it's true of all art history, all uses of photographs. But it's worth being aware of. The Model Society photographers had their own artistic intentions. The models had their own reasons for participating. Your use inherits all of that but also transforms it.

Is this appropriation? Not in the pejorative sense - you're not claiming their work as yours. But you are recontextualizing it in ways they didn't anticipate.

### On Discomfort as Pedagogy

The thesis makes a strong claim: that the reader's perceptual response to the figures *is* the argument. If so, discomfort is data. A reader who feels something when confronting nudity is experiencing the valence dimension. A reader whose attention shifts is experiencing salience collapse.

This is either profound or convenient rationalization for including provocative images.

Probably it's both. The insight is real - your responses to images *are* affect in action. But there's also a risk of using theoretical sophistication to justify choices that have other motivations.

Honest question: if the contemporary photographs were of clothed figures in the same poses, would they serve the thesis less well? If yes, why? If the nudity itself is doing intellectual work, that's one thing. If it's doing affective work that clothed images could also do, that's another.

### On the Specific Images

Let's be concrete about what we're talking about:

**modelsociety_462399** (contracted grief pose): A figure curled on a white pedestal. The nudity emphasizes vulnerability, the exposure of grief. A clothed figure in the same pose would read differently - more protected, less raw. The nudity does work here.

**modelsociety_201529** (abstract body-form): The body as pure geometry - curves, shadows, form. The nudity is almost incidental; this is closer to sculpture than portraiture. The point is the body-as-shape.

**modelsociety_626319** (dramatic chiaroscuro): High contrast, smoke, drama. The nudity here is more conventional "artistic nude" - beautiful body in beautiful light. Less obviously connected to affect theory. Does this one earn its place?

**modelsociety_491092** (baroque setting): Classical pose in ornate architecture. This is explicitly referencing art history - the figure could be a Titian or Rubens. The nudity connects to tradition. But does that connection serve your thesis or just provide cover?

Going image by image like this might help. Some may be clearly motivated by the argument. Others might be more ambiguous.

### On the Meta-Question

Why are we deliberating about this at all? What does this conversation reveal?

It reveals that you take seriously the idea that intellectual work has ethical dimensions. You're not asking "what can I get away with" but "what should I do." That's the right question.

It also reveals the inadequacy of rules. There's no principle that resolves this cleanly. "Don't include nudity" is too restrictive for a thesis about embodiment. "Include whatever serves the argument" is too permissive if you're genuinely concerned about harm.

You're stuck with judgment. With weighing considerations that can't be reduced to a formula. With accepting that reasonable people might disagree about your choices.

That's uncomfortable. But it's also what ethical reasoning actually looks like in hard cases.

### On the GitHub Repo Specifically

The repo is a specific context with specific properties:
- It's public and searchable
- It lacks the framing of the thesis document itself
- Images could be found and downloaded without reading any text
- It persists indefinitely

This is different from the thesis itself, which will be read in sequence with full context.

One option: include the images in the thesis PDF but not in the repo. Keep the repo as code/text, link to images hosted elsewhere or omit them from the public version.

This is a compromise that loses something (the repo as complete artifact) but gains something (control over context).

### On What Your Gut Actually Says

You said you want the work to be "truthful and innovative." The contemporary photographs are more innovative - using current artistic practice rather than canonized classics. They're arguably more truthful too - more immediate, less mediated.

You said you "really don't want to hurt anyone." The realistic probability of meaningful harm is low. But low isn't zero.

You said you "can't just use American convention as conscience." Right. But you also can't use contrarianism as conscience. The fact that Americans are prudish about bodies doesn't automatically mean including nudity is correct.

What's left when you strip away convention and contrarianism? What does *this work* require? What does *care for actual people* require?

Those two questions might have different answers. That's the hard part.

## Still Unresolved

- Whether the intellectual justification for these images is genuinely earned or partly rationalization
- Whether context collapse is your responsibility to mitigate
- Whether the models' consent to artistic display extends to academic use
- Whether discomfort in readers is pedagogically valuable or an obstacle to engagement
- Whether the classical art alone would actually weaken the thesis or just make it more conventional
