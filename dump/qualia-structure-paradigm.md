This talk is brought to you by the Bamberg Mathematical Consciousness Science Initiative. >> Thank you for uh invitation Johannes and also thank you everybody who are here. Uh I guess it may be very early in Europe or in the midnight in US. So um I'm going to talk about this um structure paradigm introduction. Um for some of you um like Pedro and Oyen who are in summer school a couple of weeks ago um it has some kind of overlap but I I also added some newer things. So uh hopefully it's um interesting to you and this QR code on the right side is a link to the overall paper uh link which was also accepted by the uh book that also Johannes did the um session editor um about this you know global review on the quarter structure paradigm. So the today's talk I'll start first uh with the background and then uh explain what is a quadia structure paradigm and then a structurally uh characterizing uh redness and then also try to give several examples of the empica research uh programs and uh then a future outlook. So uh to for for everybody to be on the same stage I'll just give an a definition of a codia and uh usually kia is uh identified as a phenomenal consciousness or subjective experience or content of consciousness or qualitative aspects of consciousness or feelings uh what it is like and I also uh uh basically try to be very broad and also these are all what I mean by qua and uh to contrast what it's not queria is that anything you do not have an experience directly. So for example uh if you are so this audience is half like sort of the philosophy or mathematics I guess um for those you know completely subscribe the physicalism or identity theory then you might consider brain as you know aquaria but uh for the moment I would say that you know that's not something that you can experience by yourself directly so anything you do not have an experience such as brain in processing or uh suppose like cons unconscious representation whatsoever is not for you. Okay. everything you have in a direct access you uh and including some sometimes you know uh feelings of the thoughts or feeling of the uh planning that's also uh also included in the quia and one distinction uh that may be useful to ease the confusion or sort of um debate is the distinction of a quia in a narrower or broader sense and I also put them l reference to this issue um in co-authoring with Lee Yongzi Zoe inside the archive but uh for example on the right side when you see this nice uh sunset let's imagine that you are in front of this uh surrounded by this then u your broad sense coria is uh uh what what it means is that it's a moment of experience it's a broadest in terms of categories of the things But it is one moment in that sense it is very narrow but so that that's a kind of the confusing kind of you know direction but you know it is the um moment of experience which contains everything that's the broader warrior and then narrow cora is the aspect of the broader cora that can be compared or recollected uh or uh judged upon. So for example in this case uh redness of uh this scene can be a narrow queria or circeness of the sun or you know things like that uh any kind of aspect that you can um compare report or judge that's a narrower aspects of the queria but you have only you have broader experience okay that's the distinction so uh defined in such a way um the first question is the can we deal with a quia scientifically and as Denn who uh died a couple of years ago said traditional answer is no and um qua is sometimes you know reserved for something that is non-scientific um and the usual argument goes like you know uh it is ineffable you cannot describe it enigmatic private you know uh you cannot study something p uh public uh not public scientifically or intrinsically you know you you need to observe it from extrinsically that's the argument but for basically violates everything so uh usually uh empirical researcher tend to give up and in uh as a consequence uh the neural corates of consciousness uh research program that has been very popular tends to just you know give up that quality side of the experience and then focus on the binary responses and its coordinate with the neural you activity but then the resulting studies have not provided strong constraints on the theories and then that resulted in a huge number of the theories including you know Johanes's you know mathematical terms to consciousness but the robot cun's recent study counted more than 250 theories of consciousness at this point so um but what uh uh so this situation is like this toothbrush that everybody has one that is favorite but um everybody doesn't want to use other people's you know toothbrush right um but I would also u this is the kind of the joke that Alex and also um um Alex Marin Gomez and also Sasha use but I would also add that you know you also want to change uh and test a different kind of toothbrush every three months or so if you're really serious um according to the dentist so uh I also recommend you to also turn to different kind of the theories as well once in a while and then uh in my opinion after doing so to some extent um I would say that I I think I believe uh but uh definitely you know we can u address the quous uh scientific manner and our uh specific proposal is to use the structure approach and also combined with the integrated information theory and also future scientific approaches that I'm not really you know acquainted with. So I'm also eager to learn a new different kind of theories and this is the kind of the overview uh that I wrote in this you know um uh chapter on the right side of the QR code. So the Q structure what is that? Um uh this is a name of the funding u uh kind of body and then we are trying uh we are receiving some funding from Japan and uh uh we are trying to do this uh interdisciplinary research program on uh consciousness but uh uh in particular uh what we are trying to do is u so as sort of the uh Johannes also mentioned that you know we are um uh combining very different kind of the disciplines math and like physics would be the ones primary I'm talking about today but also neuroiming neurom modulation and also symbol emergence language and phenomenology and also development and the information structures many different kind of fields are trying to collaborate to uh adopt the structural approaches um and um uh structural approach uh we are trying to lead the next generation consciousness research uh by the way There there were a couple of more additions uh recently uh some of you might uh recognize like uh Olaf Widowski and also uh Tom Frost uh and so on. Anyway, um so uh recently we have done summers go uh in Italy uh like Pedro and Soin and also uh I guess Rosario was also there. Um and then I did the two weeks of the intense summer school and we are probably going to do the again in 2027 in Hokkaido. Um so so please check it out now. Um so now I'm um more of the social scientific side. So what we are trying to deal with like you know den define uh you know noted is that the the problem of the redness which is not possible to define or characterize bubbley or from the kind of the um labeling itself. So if you want to you know characterize this redness here then what you can say at most is that oh this red is uh reminds me of you know the uh blood or you know u color of the Chinese uh flag or something like that or Japanese flag for the matter I don't know but uh above and beyond that it seems it's not possible to describe it uh but such a situation where uh characterizing things on its own is very difficult but through the relationship uh exists in the literature. For example, definition of the words um is usually given by the words in other you know words in the dictionary. So if you don't know the words to begin with, you can't really use the dictionary and also the understanding the um roles or functions of animals and plants, you need to really understand the relationship. And in fact, you know, by understanding the relationship of the animals or plants, you even don't need to know what the animals or plants are to understand ecosystems. And also to characterize a black hole, what the physicists do is to not to directly observe you know black hole itself which is impossible but its relationship with other planetary kind of objects and then precisely define you know the gravity or size and so on of the black hole. But in a sense infinity in the mass is also you know characterized through its interaction with other kind of infinity or infinite decimally small things and also the personality like you know me to characterize myself you can get to know me but also you can get to know how I'm uh affiliated with other entity or my family or you know my you know Facebook or Twitter or you know blue sky connection and things like that that tells a lot about uh inside from the outside in a sense and this is precisely the kind of the inspiration that we got from Yonma in a category theory and for those people who know the category theory you don't need a potential reminder but it is a very profound theory in mathematics where uh if you have if you're dealing with some kind of the category so-called small category then um the relationship uh of uh you know one thing oh maybe you know I I should go to the right side as a sort of consequence um relationship of an object A with uh everything else and also everything of the relationship between B and uh everything else within that category if they are the same you know isomeorphic then uh it necessarily is a case that A and B is also isomorphic. So um um just when um applying it to this you know codia structure or question of a codia what we are interested is the nature of a or b which itself is not possible to say in itself but its relationship with other uh things for example color how similar or how distant then uh we can potentially identify a and b as it is so that's the kind of ideas of the uh unit dilemma Okay. So um before going further to sort of the conceptual the the uh empirical study I want to stop here uh with uh clarification of the little bit of the philosophical implications of this paradigm. So methodologically speaking what we are trying to provide is that how to study polio itself. um you uh rather than uh saying that you know we promote that introspection or uh microfology per C relational characterization is uh uh the one that we are trying to you know propose epistemology wise um or what we can know about other people's quarter um we are saying that you know to the extent that our quarters is structure is similar to other people's you know quarter structure then we might be able to infer at least to some extent of the quarter structure in others. And uh in terms of ontological commitment um this is aligned with more like a universal criterion of consciousness and consciousness as structure and also a consciousness as starting point intrinsic experience uh from itself. And this is very different from sort of the restricted you know human centric or functional definition of a quoria or extrinsic behavior or criterion of the coria and this is the thing that we also recently wrote uh with the Franchesco area and uh uh this you know experience as a broad corer uh but this also um kind of leads to the people who are familiar with shift theory um leads to this idea of the locally consistent in a sense of the a moment of experience itself that itself is consistent but across experience if you try to make sense of the you know kind of patching of one experience to the other sometimes you know inconsistency arises and that is uh reminded us of this pre-shift but not shift kind of structure and that is a sort of structure of the chloria combining you know narrow cora does not directly combine to broad coria and a broad cora of one one moment to another moment even if there is some kind of overlap it does it may not be already you know uh implying that it's consistency across the you know moment or consciousness and also finally different quality types like you know I I imagine that it would be probably something like an atom line and that's the kind of proposal in my you know u title of the talk qua periodic table and recently I I've been also thinking about at the bottom of this you know Korea periodic table is probably like you know quark like kind of fundamentals and maybe that's related to cause or effects and also relations and that's also pretty much inspired or consistent with IAT's kind of ontology okay so um with that um I I'll go to empirical research examples. But if there is anything probably you know uh relatively short in terms of a question should I take it right now or >> so we usually have questions after the talk but um if you're happy to if there's any sort of question of understanding people can just raise their hand and we can stop. >> Yeah if it's if there's any clarification questions >> but I think everyone is expecting questions at the end so perhaps we can continue. >> All right then I'll go. Okay. So, uh now switching a little bit of gear empica research examples and so um unlike other talks probably within this you know session I I we have been doing the experiment and especially using this you know the perspective for the Korea research. So uh the first example that I'm uh giving is this uh um paper on the uh children's korea and it was published this year in PNAS uh with these people. So u the issue that we have in terms of our korea in children is that it's been uh known very long time. Um I guess you know Johannes your kids are probably around that the years but uh if uh when when you're observing the kids around three years old their uh color terms can be very very confusing you know from every day you know every day if you show the same object they might say uh different kinds of terms of color terms okay that doesn't happen for adults of course and there is almost no overlap in terms of color categorical naming across any people almost no you know errors especially if it's a basic color terms right but in the case of children it's known to have a lots of you know confusion overlaps and so on and the worst thing is this you know blue and uh green here so uh across almost all the cultures uh the same thing can be you know sometimes reported as a blue or green and even the most you know sort of salient or distinctive things like you know Um red can be also you know if it's three years old can be confused with other colors as well. So based on this if you if your quia structure or understanding queria is purely based on the language and if you really believe that you know language shapes the quia then it leads to the prediction that you know qua structure of the children should be completely messed up right like at least you know blue and green should cluster almost the same and also you know many of the things are confused across many times and then very distinct from adults But there is also a possibility that the previous you know uh approach was purely based on the language in terms of color experience. So um if you use uh if you provide this more richer potential richer ways of you know reporting similarity of the colors it could be same as adults and that's what we um thought. So um the way we investigated this is to develop this similarity experiment task by you know showing um you know color patch on the display of the iPhone very quickly. So it disappears very quickly. Okay. And um then uh kids can touch on to one of the four location to report oh it was very similar or slightly dissimilar or sim slightly similar or very dissimilar. So this touch panel uh is crucial to get the report from three, four, five years old because until like 60 six years old children really you know can't use you know mouse or even worse for the you know keyboard. But it's actually quite important to understand that you know report has been probably um unwanted kind of filter of the consciousness. uh so far most likely many of the animals are probably experiencing something but they probably don't have a proper report modalities and if we can adjust our sort of report modality like this way you know it's just changing from you know mouse or keyboard into touch panel we can get something like this very reliable uh similarity report from kids and in fact uh when you visualize the similarity relationship it's almost indistinguishable um this correlation coefficient was on the average like um at the group level of 0.9 or something like that uh for going from three to four years old to uh uh adults and we also looked at the Chinese population versus Japanese population see thinking that you know the uh association of the redness in China is very very positive throughout the you know cultural kind of tradition Red is associated repeatedly very very positive kind of thing in a rainforest in China but in Japan it's not. So sometimes you know when I wear something like this in the street in Japan then I'm considered as a kind of you know really weird guy. So you don't see much people wearing the red really red thing in Japan but that's not the case in China. But still this is red location is almost the same. So there is uh something to be uh you know studied more but um using not by the language but similarity we identify that the children's core structure is probably very similar to uh um adults. That's the first uh empirical question. So now but uh uh my um u fundamental question is that when I show something like this do I see the blue in the same way as you do without language right but using only like nine colors like we did for the kids it's very limited so what we want to do is to expand this into a much larger scale study. So we started to using this 93 colors which was previously used for the naming study. So naming for naming it's very easy to get you know 93 trials by just showing 93 color patch one at a time right. But for the similarity what we need to do is that to get the responses for all possible 93 times 93 you know combinations. So that's really time consuming. So initially what we did was to com collect more than you know uh 300,000 trials online and then uh combine that with computational technique called unsupervised structural alignment. So this is a work with masumi and also Genji and Ari and published in I science to uh this year 2005 25. So um coming back to the sort of is my red your red question right the traditional method which is still also prevalent and also it's called sometimes called a supervised method is uh starting from the assumption that you know as a kind of you know observer or experimental or god right that this red for you must be corresponding to you uh the red in here for you and then Can you quantify the relationship between those two uh or you know its relation to others by you know uh assuming that this must be the same and then compute the sort of the u deviation from the ideal that's the sort of standard structural approach but then that's kind of cheating and also you can't really address the question of is my red your red. So what we did instead is uh that uh uh to address this uh alignment approach. So in the alignment approach what is different is that um sorry uh okay um approach is that uh instead of ask uh assuming the correspondence first we mask all the color identity first and then to address whether my red is this you're this one or that one or maybe not corresponding to anything else something like that is exhaustively you know search for and then try to find the optimum mapping between them and then eventually reveal the labels to see whether the you know structurally aligned thing actually corresponds in terms of labels that's a different kind of thinking okay so uh in practice what we do is to use this uh notion called the gopasine distance and the gromosa distance is can be you know defined between the two matrixes without any kind of labels And sometimes you know the the size of the matrix can be completely different as well. And what it means uh what it tries to do is to compute all pair wise uh distance like diig and dkl and then you subtract and then square it and then penalize it in a sense with you know ik and jl entry of the one matrix. So if DIG and DKJL is identical in terms of similarity like you know both are similar or both are dissimilar then IK and JL entry of the gamma should be low right uh high high as high as possible but uh if it's you know very different then uh it should be you know lower and then by so doing uh what we end up in finding is that um some kind of transportation matrix matrix that allows you to go from one domain to the other with minimum difference in terms of relational structure in a sense the shape is preserved between uh transportation. So for example you know if you have two kinds of a structure red and so you know red circle and you know a blue square then you rotate and stretch and so you transfer transport um things into sort of the in the middle you know we don't need to assign one particular thing to one particular thing as well in this you know setting then we end up in this you know nice alignment uh structure and then finally we reveal that you know Ah actually the labels were all correct like this and then that's a perfect kind of you know label matching and this is the one swap matching. So here it could be argued that oh yes we finally found you know inverted example in the real person. Okay that's the uh kind of idea because we didn't use the uh initial you know mapping. If that this is actually really found then that isn't a very strong evidence that you know maybe there isn't a invert empirically and all of this is detailed and given a many very nice example in general neuroscience methods and high science paper by Ken Tedda and under the supervision of Masami. So um I think you know it would be uh great if you can take a look uh at that if you're further interested. So um I'll just skip uh okay so what we empirically do uh to for the visualization wise is that the from the dissimilarity matrix on the left side in the 93 colors we get some kind of embeddings and here for just you know uh the uh visualization purpose I'm just you know showing it in a three dimension but as you can kind of observe already that Even the most white kind of point are located in the center which is very weird and alo black one is also located very close to sort of the um blue or you know um purple kind of thing. So this is not really something that you would expect from the three-dimensional color space but I I will uh give you more further kind of you know um um explanation about this if you're interested but anyway the uh visualization here is just the lower dimensional projection of much higher dimensional color space especially if you assume that the ukidian space is there then um it's really high dimension so Um now that we uh online experiment has an limitation in the sense that you know each person can do only 100 trials or something like that. So we aggregated a response from group one from 100 people group two 100 people A1 100 people and then after doing this optimal transportation without looking at the levels what we find is that the group one and two is almost perfectly aligned and its accuracy is almost like 90% or something like that but group T1 and the group A1 doesn't align at all so we you know but we are actually happy because a group A1 one is a ka atypical people. We uh selected it on online using Ishihara test and other kind of you know technique and then we found that you know these people actually do have a different kind of color um structure. It's not two dimensional. It's also very high dimensional but it just doesn't align with uh T1 uh typical group. So, so far so good and then we have already published it and it's actually uh featured in some you know blog and also uh news and also uh so on. So it we were very happy with that but uh there was still also lots of comments on on YouTube uh uh video and so on. And one of the criticism is that although the title of the paper says is my red your red actually what we are doing is is our red similar to their red because we are always averaging across many many people right. So to address this we finally did this experiment of same logic but you know really applying it to the my red similar to your red and that that's done by Yutoashi in collaboration with Yukiosoto and Masahumi again. So here what you did it's a very tedious experiment is that uh he collected 4,800 trials in total over five days from given participant. So they came to the lab day one day two day three day four day five and then did a little bit of the paral perceptual testing and then similarity similarity similarity over the you know many many trials. Okay, at least you know uh 15 sessions or something like that. And then uh we got all these data at a single level participant level and from 11 people including uh uh three color typical and four color atypical and also four self reported color atypical people which uh will will be um very interesting in the in the moment. So this is uh the result intermediate results where we just align the you know relationship between the three people without really knowing the you know label. So you see all these dots are black because we didn't put any kind of colors right and then uh here is the results of uh you know on top of that you know alignment finally we reveal this you know color labels and as you can see almost perfectly you know color labels are matching between three people almost perfect. So here uh we are very confident that the person one two three are having almost the same kind of color similarity structures and here there's no absolute you know averaging going on and this is the summary of our experimental results and then this T1 to T3 the these are the people who are kind of you know matching and we we used a very strict kind of matching rate accuracy criteria top one only you know only exactly the same one it counts as you know correct right but it's also interesting to note that you know color atypical people also match with them very well but atypical and typical people do not match at all and then also further interesting thing is that you know self-reported intermediate color uh deficit people have sometimes you know very well matching kind of structure with the typical people but also sometimes also have more or less you know intermediate kind of matching as well with the kind of atypical people. So they're sort of the subjective uh report or plus you know some kind of psychical evaluation which puts them into the intermediate actually has some kind of you know phenomenological um and some mathematical corates to it and uh Johannes uh How like do I have 10 minutes, five minutes? >> Of course. Yeah, absolutely. 10 sounds good. >> 10 minutes. All right. >> No strict pressure. >> Okay. So the interm summary uh up to now uh focusing on the color side is that uh I pro uh introduced this structure characterization the kia focusing mostly on the color is my color structure similar to your color similarity structures and then um I also you know provided quantifying structures through this optimum transportation method and then uh with that you know we can align codia structures without labels and then this kind of approach is in fact applicable about many other corer uh for example emotion or visual motion and so on and in fact this is the next thing that I'm going to talk about visual motion so um the next step in terms of theoretical kind of bigger picture wise is that we have now established a way to characterize or address measure this coria structure in a given person and then uh what we think is going on is that that there is some kind of you know a brainbased sort of a structure and according to um my opinion you know integrated information theory by Toni and so on are probably closest to propose anything like this kind of structural uh you know entity out of the uh physical substrate. So I I basically you know propose this one right now. So in terms of IAT, you know, Larissa probably explained uh two days ago. Uh it um gives rise to this causal structures unfolded from the physical substructure. And then what it predicts is that if my red experience here is corresponding to this structure according to IIAT and in my brain state at that point then the similarity of other Korea should be also reflected or mirrored in this similarity of the causal structure according to IIT and if it's not the case then I can be refuted. What I mean is that for example if I say that you know red is very similar to violet right but I says that no violet should be actually very very different from red. In fact you know if you look at the wavelength violet is very close to the ultraviolet uh very short wavelength and then red is very close to infrared very you know long wavelength. So if the physicalism is true which is not the case that you know IT proposes then it should automatically almost like red and purple should be different very different but that's not the case and if I automatically also arrives completely different you know uh reasons red and the purple is very close predictably from this kind of cod structure then that actually lends a support for IAT. So this is a kind of you know circular uh confirmation kind of you know strategy in qual research and in fact uh what I uh think is an solution or dissolution of how the problem is precisely this. So if I start from the corer structure of a person a in one particular coria and then another one in a other person and how it's related how it's similar how it's different is precisely or you know uh defined through u not really like uh similar kind the the concept of the isomorphism or onetoone mapping but more like an adjunction for those people who know you know mathematical uh techn technical term of the junction which is that you know if you if I go from A to B and then coming back to A there may be some kind of displacement but the displacement is so coherent that you know A and B can communicate to each other and in fact this must be the case I would say in terms of cor structure because everybody is most likely different very diff not very different to the extent that it doesn't allow us to communicate but it is probably different you know even the had a coded structure case individual it's not identical structure it it has some kind of difference but it doesn't uh you know recruit our communication so this is a a junction kind of you know relationship and it may be also the case for between the experience and so cause effect structure like that and then if we can go from one coh one quarter structure to cause effect structure to another cause effect structure to back to structure this kind of you commutative direction if that coincides with direct you know uh transformation from a quarter structure to qual structure then I would say that's the that's the end of the sort of the hard problem error but it's really it's going to take really long time but I would say this is a sort of theoretical kind of a solution to um hard problem okay and then uh So in a sense you know what my rest of the life probably is going to be devoted is to establish or test whether the diagram commute or not right and um um as a first step towards this goal this is the last kind of empirical experiment that I'm going to talk about is um going from human to sort of the neural plus also cause effect structure. So this is the recent latest u um bio archive preprint that we uploaded by Kam Robinson. Sorry I I I I missed the M here. Anyway, in collaboration with Yoshimura, Yumiko Yoshima and Ja. So what the column did is to start with um very basic kind of sensory coria which doesn't even need language which is visual motion and visual motion is very likely to be present in also animals and so that's actually a very nice kind of a modality to investigate but to our surprise nobody actually uh even ask the question of similarity of the visual motion from one to the other and probably you know this A very sk speculative kind of a question uh the statement but most likely philosopher physicist mathematician psychologist and so on neuroscientist probably assume that you know space and time and also it's derivative or you know maybe motion maybe you know more fundamental than space and time they are so fundamental that uh it must be almost like a transparent or um reflecting the world as it is. So there is no almost like you know a point in asking similarity of the visual motion. It's sometimes called transparency kind of argument or assumption. But when uh kind of did this experiment using two different uh you know visual motion briefly presented uh 250 millconds or something like that then the first stimulus and also second stimulus resulted in already very interesting kind of pattern. one that uh uh the same kind of stimulus repeated twice does not necessarily always gives rise to the higher similarity. People feel sometimes it's different even though it's the same. Okay. I also uh it's often the case that you know the asymmetric uh presentation uh one then a then b is different from b then a and uh we are now doing this kind of you know large scale u experiment but it's probably going to be very significantly true for some particular combination of the motion. So this implies that we need some kind of math or some kind of you know methods to understand the similarity through not the ukidian distance but something that is asymmetric and sometimes also even not minimal like same thing does not need to be zero. Okay so that's the kind of you know request the mathematician to come up with a new mathematics of the similarity. All right. Then uh so this uh particular part is this you know green uh square but as you can see across different spatial frequency so roughly speaking this you know uh big numbers corresponds to the coarseness of the grating. So 0.04 is very coarse. The 1.16 is a very fine grating. And uh if you squint your eyes then you can see that you know different you know special frequency look different. you know that it's generally black, right? But along the diagonal that's the exactly same direction. So same direction across different spatial frequency look similar. That's okay. But what's very interesting to me was that the 180 degree difference like here along this you know diagonal they look almost same as the central. So what it means is that the if you look at the two motions going to the right and the left it actually looks similar. Okay. But if you think that the motion is fundamentally kind of directional then it must be you know it's really ridiculous right? I mean in fact the motion psychophysics motion neuroscience starts almost from looking for the neurons that look that activates you know in a very different way from going to the right go to the going to the left that is the sort of definition of visual motion but if you ask people then that's not how it looks like so people tend to feel that the opposite of motion to be similar that's the one of the you know biggest message here. So um if you visualize this you know relationship then this is how uh you know we came up with in terms of the two dimension MDS. So all the pairs of the opposite motion are grouped very very similar close to each other and then there are some kind of you know uh grade from low frequency to high frequency and then there is some kind of you know also the uh clustering of the horizontal or you know vertical but that's a little bit less you know clear. So this is a sort of a basic kind of you know uh structure for the visual motion for now. But then next step, so what can we do with a cause effect structure? So here comes Yumiko's you know nice experiment. She basically did use all the same you know stimulus and then presented to mouse with anesthesia and a way and then recorded all the neurons she could in the B1 roughly like sometimes you know 280 neurons but some of the most responsive ones are 80 neurons or something like that and then we were able to identify each individual neurons and then uh look at this kind of you know characteristic response you know patterns and then based on that we can also So compute you know as an first approximation what is the similarity between the pattern of the neurons response from one motion pattern to another motion pattern right you can imagine that 80 neurons as a uh represented as one time 80 vector and then for the motion you know a uh you compute uh motion a and motion b you compute the correlation between this you know one vector to another vector and If it's completely you know uh correlated that means that the distance of zero most similar. Okay. And so when we did that this is what we found. So we see you know that it's an by definition the diagonal must be zero. So there is in a sense you know uh we are wrong about this because mouse should not sometimes see the same thing as same but you know this is a starting point and then here this off diagonal you know 180 degree different that comes up as most similar actually and uh unlike humans there is a also very sharp kind of you know difference in terms of low spatial frequency and low spatial frequency. So the uh row you know similarity structure is looking like this. It's not that similar to the human similarity structure. So that's where we are right now. And um here it's an of course you know we are comparing you know you can complete you can say that it's an comparing them apples and orange but it's even worse human psychopysics with mouse neural response. But this is just a starting point. We are going to do something like you know going from mouse response to mouse cause effect structure or human psych physics to potentially collaborating with the doctors to get to the human intercanial recording to get something similar in human but that's a sort of the next you know couple of years of the plants. So that uh we we are doing this through the screening of all neural interaction patterns and also you know including cause effect structures and so on and that's what I said right now. So the conclusion was um establishing a paradigm to study cod scientifically we need to go beyond binary NCC paradigms and then we advocate this in structure approach and then in terms of math I think a category theory is still necessary you know I kind of intersperse some kind of um bits and pieces of the potential collaboration for she theory as well as this you know uh enriched category theory which does not require a symmetry of the distance And also the empirical we can do lots of similarity experiments that we need to do and many different kind of context as well and also neural recording to be um collaborated with other people and then eventually through uh dissolve the hard problem of so uh I'll just uh skip this ongoing studies but you know we are also studying the effects of attention and the words and so psychiatric population emotions and so sounds and so on And uh u but all of this also requires some kind of mathematization in the end. And then uh we want to see what what explains the difference in terms of between the vision versus sound versus smell. There must be some kind of probably topological difference in terms of math or what what I don't know. But why this you know modality is so different needs to be answered in some way right. So with that uh I want to acknowledge the wonders primarily the Japan uh society for promotion sciences but also I'm also supported by some Australian researchers and this is a photo for the quarter structure on the bottom and so top right is the recent uh uh picture taken in Italy and the top left is our lab in the middle. Thank you uh for listening and I'll take any questions.
