need a better description here

better metaphors please

> We say it is like being anxious, like being in love, like being ashamed, like being in flow, like waking from a dream and carrying a residue of unreality into the day.

this is not a common use of the word. how about “We talk about what it is like to be in love, to …

> because persistence is never merely given. A difference that does not persist is only a contrast in a single frame, a transient imbalance that disappears as soon as the world mixes.

you could add, a Boltzman brain that spawned without purpose

> A cell membrane is a boundary. A skin is a boundary. The insulation around a wire is a boundary. The walls of a house are a boundary. A checksum and a redundancy code are boundaries for information. A legal identity is a boundary in social reality. Attention is a boundary in cognition. Every boundary is a kind of selective permeability: it admits some flows, blocks others, and thereby stabilizes a distinction that would otherwise degrade. But boundaries are never free. The cell membrane is maintained. The skin is repaired. The wire insulation is manufactured and replaced. The house is heated and sealed. The checksum is computed and verified. The legal identity is enforced and defended. Attention is allocated and reallocated. 

Let’s narrow this down to only use the cell, skin, and attention. 

> A “static structure,” seen honestly, is simply a dynamical equilibrium that has become so familiar we mistake it for stillness.

add another sentence after this: but it’s really already been dynamics first, statics second in this universe

> If you have ever watched a river carve a canyon, you have seen constraint-driven inevitability: water does not choose, yet it converges on channels, meanders, deltas—forms that arise again and again because the rules of flow and erosion make them attractors.

maybe we could go back to snowflakes here actually. 

also, remove the example about discovering patterns in a system. Add one about ideological audience converging on similar ideas. Just do snowflake, attention (the shape of human experience/condition), evolution. 

> This is where compression enters as more than a clever metaphor. 

I think before this, you could give a paragraph or two on how a system must build an internal model of the environment in order to anticipate the challenges that it will face that needed to maintain his boundary. Basically a friston style free energy discussion. Then you can allowing that the world model must be smaller than the world since it’s inside it so it must compress—and then go on

> A system that wastes resources on distinctions that do not matter will be outcompeted by one that preserves only what changes outcomes.

true but our discussion does not require competition. it is now focused in the essence of existence by itself in the first place

> Rather than merely resisting blurring at the skin, the nervous system resists blurring at the level of prediction and control. It builds a latent state—a compact internal configuration—that stands in for the world and for the body’s needs. It updates that latent state moment by moment to keep behavior adaptive. It is here, in the internalization of maintenance into representation and self-correction, that consciousness becomes not a mystery but a natural next step in the causal story.

you could add something inside here about how the model begins to model its own state within a smaller meta level latent state and here is where the self awareness emerges
