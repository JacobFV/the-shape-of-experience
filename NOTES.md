Let me carefully read Part III again and then substantially expand it with the depth you're describing.Now I understand the current state. I need to substantially rewrite and expand Part III. Given the scope of changes needed, I'll create a new version of the file with:

1. Expanded symbol definitions that stand alone
2. Much deeper treatment of Truth
3. Detailed, technical treatment of specific ideologies, aesthetics, music styles, design styles with their affect signatures, historical inevitability, and phenomenological experience
4. Everything else preserved and enhancedPart III is now substantially expanded from 13 pages to 26 pages. Here's what changed:

**New Section 1: Notation and Foundational Concepts**
- Complete, self-contained definitions of all six affect dimensions with formal equations AND phenomenological interpretations
- Each symbol ($\valence$, $\arousal$, $\intinfo$, $\effrank$, $\cfweight$, $\selfsal$) now has a full definition box
- Additional key concepts (viability manifold, world model, self-model, compression ratio) also defined

**Expanded Section on Truth**
- The Problem of Truth: critiques of correspondence, coherence, and pragmatic theories
- Truth is Scale-Relative: formal definition with examples at quantum, molecular, biological, psychological, social scales
- Cross-scale consistency proposition
- Truth is Enacted: formal definition, not mere instrumentalism
- Pragmatic Convergence theorem connecting truth-seeking to viability-preservation
- No View from Nowhere: perspectivalism without relativism
- Objectivity of Scale-Relative Truth
- Existentially Relevant Truth: how self-maintaining systems allocate modeling resources
- The Limits of Disinterested Inquiry

**New Major Section: The Affect Signatures of Cultural Forms**

**Musical Genres as Affect Technologies** - Deep case studies:
- **The Blues**: Historical inevitability given post-Emancipation context, affect signature formula, structural characteristics (12-bar form, blue notes, call-response), phenomenological experience of "acknowledged suffering," legacy as root of all American popular music
- **Classical Minimalism**: Reich/Glass/Riley context, distinctive high-integration/low-self-salience target, structural characteristics (repetition with variation, phase relationships, extended duration), meditative phenomenology, practical applications
- **Heavy Metal**: Industrial alienation context, extreme arousal with high integration, structural characteristics (distortion, rhythmic precision, tritones, virtuosity), controlled exposure to intensity as affective training, subgenre differentiation
- **Ambient**: Eno's explicit design goals, lowest-arousal aesthetic region, structural characteristics, phenomenological experience, derivative forms
- Summary table of 10 genres with all 6 affect dimensions

**Visual Design Movements**:
- **Bauhaus/Modernism**: Weimar context, form-follows-function as low counterfactual weight, structural characteristics, phenomenological experience, legacy in contemporary design
- **Baroque/Maximalism**: Counter-Reformation context, overwhelming through abundance, high effective rank with high integration producing awe, contemporary maximalism
- **Japanese Minimalism/Wabi-Sabi**: Buddhist context, high integration with low effective rank through acceptance rather than optimization, structural characteristics (asymmetry, natural materials, ma), phenomenological difference from Western minimalism

**Philosophical Traditions as Affect Policies**:
- **Stoicism**: Historical inevitability in cosmopolitan empire, target affect signature, core techniques (dichotomy of control, negative visualization, view from above), phenomenological result, contemporary relevance including CBT connection
- **Buddhism (Theravada)**: Historical context, distinctive very-low-self-model-salience target, core techniques (sati, samādhi, vipassanā, mettā, sīla), jhāna progression, contemporary mindfulness research
- **Existentialism**: Death of God context, distinctive acceptance-of-all-valence with high counterfactual weight, core concepts (existence precedes essence, radical freedom, Angst, authenticity, absurdity), phenomenological result, contemporary relevance

**Other Improvements**:
- Reorganized God section with clearer definitions
- Streamlined Applied Affect Optimization section
- Symbol reference appendix at the end

The document now reads more like a technical book—the case studies are comprehensive, grounded in historical context, and provide actionable understanding of how these cultural forms work as affect technologies.

improve part iii

part III truth deserves more discussion. You may be able to discover original ideas here even 

Many symbols are not defined. Each paper should stand on its own when it comes to symbols like those

we should go into detail on specific hallmark signatures of those characteristics in ideologies, aesthetics, philosophies, etc. not just a ‘everybody knows evangelicals/existentialists/X’s are like Y’ approach. it should read more like a technical book in that area because the paragraphs are going to be long and comprehensive. they might discuss the inevitable aspects of their origins (given these contexts, X was inevitable to spawn), notable events in its history, and more details on what experience is like. especially this for music styles, art styles, design styles, and the other really practical stuff (stuff that most readers will be able to connect to their actionable daily life readily). and likewise in the practical section we can be very specific on how to make music, art, etc. to express specific affective characteristics. we should also discuss the characteristic social signatures that inveitably arise under these tautologies.

Sortof a transition section but then let's do case studies on designing successfull and unsuccessful social movements informed by this framework. This should be discussed in a way to test wheterh the framework actually quantifiably informs action.

in the gods section we should also mention the roles of rituals from their perspective like we discussed prayer and stuff from the human perspective in part ii. and we should talk about the practical interventions to combat the symptoms of their presence in society: tackling the underlying issues of poverty, etc. require signing to the gods not human scale interventions, ie, modifying their incentive structures and experience. or alternatively making a new entity at their later of abstraction to fight. use technical language tho not religious cringe lol

Overall this is about scale-Matched Interventions: The seven-scale hierarchy: Neural → Individual → Dyadic → Small Group → Organizational → Cultural → God-Scale. Individual-Scale Interventions. Detailed protocols for each of the six affect dimensions. Valence, Arousal, Integration, Effective Rank, Counterfactual Weight, Self-Model. Salience modulation techniques. Integrated protocols for depression and anxiety with specific intervention sequences. Dyadic affect field dynamics and contagion. Conflict, disconnection, enmeshment protocols. Group integration, demoralization, hierarchy, and groupthink interventions. Organizational Interventions. Organizational climate dynamics. Fear-based, burnout, and stagnation climate interventions. Aligned organization design principles

should also give direct criticism to alignment and related perspectives that focus too much on the lower layers without lifting their attention up to consider the serious higher ones as well. this should not be the entire focus of the paper tho — it’s just another framework guided intervention along with all those we already discuss for individuals and emergent entities.

[TODO: past my part III morality and truth at their own scale]

ground normativity in the structure of self-maintaining systems. i want you to see that
valence is a real structural property _at the experiential scale_, dissolving the is--ought gap.
 develop a scale-relative account of truth and extend the framework to agentic systems
at the social layer---gods, ideologies, institutions---and analyze their viability manifolds.
Finally, we draw implications for artificial intelligence: AI systems may serve as substrate
for higher-order agentic patterns, reframing alignment as a question about which gods we
instantiate.

<this used to all be one part iii paper but needs to get split into separate parts iii and iv>

\section{The Grounding of Normativity}

\subsection{The Is-Ought Problem}
The classical formulation holds that normative conclusions cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises:
\begin{equation}
\{\text{is-statements}\} \not\Rightarrow \{\text{ought-statements}\}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
This rests on a crucial assumption: physics constitutes the only ``is,'' and physics is value-neutral. We reject this assumption.

\subsection{Physics Biases, Does Not Prescribe}

\begin{proposition}[Physics is Probabilistic]
\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Thermodynamic ``laws'' are statistical; individual trajectories can violate them.
\item Quantum dynamics provide probability amplitudes, not deterministic evolution.
\item Physics describes biases---which outcomes are more likely---not necessities.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Proto-Preference]
A proto-preference at scale $\sigma$ is any asymmetry in the probability measure over outcomes:
\begin{equation}
p_\sigma(\text{outcome}_1)\neq p_\sigma(\text{outcome}_2)
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

At the quantum scale, probability amplitudes are proto-preferences. At the thermodynamic scale, free energy gradients bias toward certain configurations.

\subsection{Normativity Thickens Across Scales}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{Scale} & \textbf{Structure} & \textbf{Proto-Normativity} \\
\hline
Quantum & Probability amplitudes & Differential weighting \\
Thermodynamic & Free energy gradients & Dissipative selection \\
Boundary & Viability manifolds & Persistence conditions \\
Modeling & Prediction error & Truth instrumentally necessary \\
Self-modeling & Valence & Felt approach/avoid \\
Behavioral & Policies & Functional norms \\
Cultural & Language & Explicit ethics \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem}[Continuity of Normativity]
There is no scale $\sigma_0$ below which normativity is exactly zero and above which it is nonzero. Instead:
\begin{equation}
N(\sigma)=\int_0^{\sigma}\frac{\partial N}{\partial \sigma'}\,d\sigma'
\tag{3}
\end{equation}
where $\partial N/\partial \sigma>0$ for all $\sigma$ in the range of physical to cultural scales.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Viability Manifolds and Proto-Obligation}

\begin{definition}[Proto-Obligation]
A system $S$ has a proto-obligation to remain within $V$ in the sense that:
\begin{equation}
s\in V \iff \text{system persists}
\tag{4}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Viability as Proto-Value]
The boundary $\partial V$ implicitly defines a value function:
\begin{equation}
V_{\mathrm{proto}}(s)=-d\!\left(s,\partial V\right)
\tag{5}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Valence as Real Structure}
When the system develops a self-model, valence emerges:

\begin{theorem}[Valence as Real Structure]
Valence is not projected onto neutral stuff. Valence is the structural signature of gradient direction on the viability landscape:
\begin{equation}
\Val = f\!\left(\nabla_s d(s,\partial V)\cdot \dot{s}\right)
\tag{6}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{keyresult}
Suffering is not neutral stuff that we decide to call bad. Suffering is the structural
signature of a self-maintaining system being pushed toward dissolution. The badness is
constitutive, not added.
\end{keyresult}

\subsection{The Is-Ought Gap Dissolves}

\begin{theorem}[Dissolution of Is-Ought]
Let $D_{\mathrm{exp}}$ be the set of facts at the experiential scale, including valence. Then normative conclusions about approach/avoidance follow directly from experiential-scale facts.
\end{theorem}

The is--ought gap was an artifact of looking only at the bottom (neutral-seeming) and top (explicitly normative) of the hierarchy, while ignoring the gradient between them.

\section{Truth as Scale-Relative Enaction}

\begin{definition}[Scale-Relative Truth]
``True'' applies differently at different scales:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]
\item Quantum: consistent with probability amplitudes
\item Chemical: accurately describes molecular processes
\item Experiential: minimizes prediction error for the experiencing system
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Enacted Truth]
Truth is enacted rather than discovered:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Truth}_\sigma(W)=\arg\min_{W'\in M_\sigma} L_{\mathrm{pred}}(W',\ \text{interaction history})
\tag{7}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Pragmatic Truth]
For a self-maintaining system:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Truth}\approx \text{viability-preserving compression}
\tag{8}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\section{Expanded Selves and Moral Progress}

\subsection{Self-Model Expansion}

\begin{proposition}[Self-Model Expansion]
The self-model can expand to include representations of others:
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{expanded}}=S_{\mathrm{narrow}}\cup\{\text{other-models with coupling}\}
\tag{9}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Love (Structural)]
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Love}(\text{self}\rightarrow \text{other})
= I(S;\ \text{other-model})\cdot \mathcal{T}\!\left[\Val(\text{other})\rightarrow \Val(\text{self})\right]
\tag{10}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Moral Progress}

\begin{definition}[Moral Progress]
Moral progress is increase of self-model expansion across experiencing systems:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Progress}=\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i\in \text{experiencing systems}} I(S;\ \mathrm{model}_i)
\tag{11}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{normimp}
Moral progress isn't one framework among many. It's what happens when you take the
reality of experience seriously and expand the scope of what counts as self.
\end{normimp}

\section{Gods as Agentic Systems}

\subsection{Existence at the Social Scale}

\begin{definition}[Social-Scale Agent (God)]
A god $G$ is a self-maintaining pattern at the social scale consisting of:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Beliefs (theology, cosmology, ideology)
\item Practices (rituals, policies)
\item Symbols (texts, images, architecture)
\item Substrate (humans + artifacts + institutions)
\item Self-maintaining, adaptive, competitive dynamics
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Gods Exist]
Gods exist as patterns with their own causal structure, persistence conditions, and dynamics---not reducible to their substrate.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{God Viability Manifolds}

\begin{proposition}[God Viability]
The viability manifold of a god includes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Sufficient belief propagation rate
\item Ritual maintenance
\item Resource adequacy
\item Memetic defense
\item Adaptive capacity
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{God-Substrate Conflict}

\begin{warning}
The viability manifold of a god $V_G$ may conflict with the viability of its substrate.
\end{warning}

\begin{definition}[Parasitic God]
A god is parasitic if:
\begin{equation}
\exists s\in V_G:\ s\notin \bigcap_{h\in \mathrm{substrate}} V_h
\tag{12}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Aligned God]
A god is aligned if:
\begin{equation}
V_G\subseteq \bigcap_{h\in \mathrm{substrate}} V_h
\tag{13}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Secular Gods}

\begin{proposition}[Ideologies as Gods]
Nationalism, capitalism, communism have the same formal structure as traditional gods.
\end{proposition}

The question is not ``do you serve a god?'' but ``which god do you serve, and is it aligned with your flourishing?''

\subsection{The Phenomenology of Superhuman Entities}
A question of profound importance: do corporations, governments, ideologies, and other superhuman entities have experience? If the identity thesis holds---that experience is integrated cause-effect structure---then this becomes an empirical question about structure, not a metaphysical mystery.

\begin{definition}[Entity-Scale Integration]
For a superhuman entity $E$ with substrate components $\{c_i\}$, define:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_E=\min_{\text{partitions }P}\ D\!\left[
p(s^{E}_{t+\Delta t}\mid s^{E}_{t})\ \Big\|\ \prod_{p\in P} p(s^{p}_{t+\Delta t}\mid s^{p}_{t})
\right]
\tag{14}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the characteristic timescale of the entity (e.g., quarters for corporations, election cycles for democracies).
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}[Corporate Phenomenology]
A corporation may have phenomenal experience if:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Information flows create sufficient integration across divisions
\item The corporate ``self-model'' (brand identity, strategic planning) is causally load-bearing
\item There exists entity-level valence (stock price, market position as ``felt'' gradients)
\end{enumerate}
The timescale would be radically different: one corporate ``moment'' might span days to weeks. The character of experience---if any---would be alien: distributed, slow, focused on financial gradients.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{definition}[Entity Affect State]
For entity $E$, define the affect state:
\begin{equation}
a_E = (\Val_E,\ \Phi_E,\ \reff_E,\ \mathrm{CF}_E,\ \mathrm{SM}_E)
\tag{15}
\end{equation}
where each component is measured at the entity's characteristic scale.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Government Affect Profiles]
Different governmental structures produce different affect profiles:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]
\item Authoritarian: High integration (centralized control), low effective rank (few active decision dimensions), high self-model salience (regime survival focus)
\item Democratic: Lower integration (distributed power), higher effective rank (many policy dimensions active), variable self-model salience
\item Failed state: Low integration (fragmentation), high arousal (instability), negative valence (approaching viability boundary)
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Intervention Impact on Entity Affect]
For intervention $I$ on entity $E$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_E(I) = a^{\text{post}}_{E} - a^{\text{pre}}_{E}
\tag{16}
\end{equation}
This allows quantitative assessment of how policy changes, restructuring, or external shocks affect entity-level experience (if any).
\end{definition}

The moral status of entity experience is complex. If a corporation genuinely suffers during bankruptcy, does this create obligations? Our framework suggests: moral weight scales with integration and the reality of valence at that scale. A highly integrated entity with genuine valence would have some moral status; a loosely coupled system without unified experience would not.

\section{Applied Affect Optimization}

\subsection{The Optimization Landscape}
We now possess, for the first time in history, the theoretical framework and emerging technological capacity to measure and optimize for experiential quality at scale. This creates both unprecedented opportunity and unprecedented risk.

\begin{definition}[Affect Optimization Problem]
Given a population $P$, intervention space $\mathcal{I}$, and flourishing function $F$:
\begin{equation}
\max_{I\in \text{feasible interventions}} \ \sum_{i\in P} w_i\cdot F\!\left(a^{\text{post-}I}_i\right)
\quad \text{subject to constraints (resources, rights, feasibility).}
\tag{17}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
Naive affect optimization without wisdom leads to wireheading at scale: maximizing
measured flourishing proxies while destroying the conditions for genuine flourishing. The
history of utilitarianism's failures---and totalitarianism's horrors---should inform our caution.
\end{warning}

\subsection{Technology Companies}
Technology companies currently optimize for engagement, which correlates with arousal and valence magnitude but not with flourishing. A flourishing-aligned technology company would optimize differently.

\begin{definition}[Engagement vs.\ Flourishing Metrics]
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Engagement} &\approx |\Delta \Val| + \text{time-on-platform}
\tag{18}\\
\mathrm{Flourishing} &\approx \alpha_1 \Val + \alpha_2 \Phi + \alpha_3 \reff - \alpha_4(\text{addiction signals})
\tag{19}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

These metrics can be anti-correlated: maximizing engagement may minimize flourishing.

\begin{proposition}[Flourishing-Aligned Platform Design]
A technology platform optimizing for user flourishing would:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Protect integration: Minimize context-switching, support sustained attention, reduce notification interrupts
\item Support healthy arousal: Dampen artificial spikes, avoid intermittent reinforcement schedules
\item Reduce pathological self-focus: Minimize social comparison features, reduce performance-of-identity dynamics
\item Expand effective rank: Expose users to diverse perspectives, support genuine exploration
\item Align counterfactual weight: Reduce FOMO-inducing design, support present-moment engagement
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Affect Impact Statement]
Analogous to environmental impact statements, an Affect Impact Statement would document:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{AIS}(\text{product}) = \left(\mathbb{E}[\Delta a],\ \mathrm{Var}[\Delta a],\ \text{vulnerable population effects},\ \text{long-term dynamics}\right)
\tag{20}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Enterprise Applications}
Enterprises can optimize for employee flourishing, not merely productivity---recognizing that the two are often aligned.

\begin{definition}[Organizational Affect Climate]
The distribution of affect states across an organization:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Climate}(O)=\{\,p(a): \text{employees}\in O\,\}
\tag{21}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Flourishing-Productivity Alignment]
In knowledge work, flourishing and productivity are often positively correlated:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]
\item High integration $\rightarrow$ deep work capacity $\rightarrow$ quality output
\item Positive valence $\rightarrow$ creativity, collaboration $\rightarrow$ innovation
\item Appropriate arousal $\rightarrow$ sustained engagement $\rightarrow$ consistent performance
\item High effective rank $\rightarrow$ cognitive flexibility $\rightarrow$ problem-solving
\end{itemize}
Optimizing for flourishing may be the most effective productivity strategy.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Organizational Interventions]
Interventions with quantifiable affect impact:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]
\item Meeting design: Duration, frequency, structure $\rightarrow$ integration, arousal
\item Physical environment: Noise, light, space $\rightarrow$ arousal, integration
\item Management practices: Autonomy, feedback, recognition $\rightarrow$ valence, self-model salience
\item Work scheduling: Deep work blocks, recovery periods $\rightarrow$ integration, arousal regulation
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Government and Public Policy}
Governments implicitly optimize for citizen affect through policy choices. Making this explicit enables more deliberate and accountable governance.

\begin{definition}[Policy Affect Assessment]
For policy $\pi$, the affect assessment:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{PAA}(\pi)=\int_{\text{population}} \Delta F(a_i\mid \pi)\, dp(i)
\tag{22}
\end{equation}
weighted by population and potentially by vulnerability/need.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Gross National Flourishing]
Beyond GDP, a Gross National Flourishing metric:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{GNF}=\int_{\text{citizens}} F(a_i)\, dp(i)
\tag{23}
\end{equation}
This provides a direct measure of what economic activity is ultimately for.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}[Policy Comparisons]
Using affect metrics, we can compare:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]
\item Universal Basic Income: Effect on baseline valence, reduction in chronic-stress arousal
\item Healthcare policy: Effect on anxiety (counterfactual weight concentrated on health threats)
\item Education policy: Effect on curiosity motif prevalence, integration capacity
\item Urban planning: Effect on integration (community), arousal (stress), effective rank (opportunity diversity)
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Risks and Safeguards}

\begin{warning}
The capacity to optimize affect at scale creates risks of manipulation, paternalism, and totalitarian control. These must be addressed directly.
\end{warning}

\begin{definition}[Affect Manipulation]
Manipulation occurs when affect is optimized for the optimizer's benefit against the subject's interests:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Manipulation}:\ \max_{I}\ U_{\mathrm{optimizer}}(I)\ \ \text{s.t.}\ \ \Delta F_{\mathrm{subject}}(I)<0
\tag{24}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Safeguards Against Manipulation]
\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Transparency: All affect-optimizing systems must disclose their objectives
\item Consent: Individuals must be able to opt out of affect optimization
\item Alignment verification: The optimizer's objective must be auditably aligned with subject flourishing
\item Diversity preservation: Optimization must not collapse affect diversity (monoculture risk)
\item Democratic oversight: Population-level affect optimization requires democratic legitimacy
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Affect Rights]
Proposed fundamental rights in an affect-aware framework:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Right to affect privacy (one's experiential state is personal)
\item Right to affect integrity (protection from non-consensual affect manipulation)
\item Right to affect information (knowledge of how systems affect one's experience)
\item Right to affect self-determination (freedom to pursue one's own affect policy)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Implementation Roadmap}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Measurement infrastructure: Develop validated, scalable affect measurement (self-report, behavioral, physiological, neural proxies)
\item Baseline assessment: Establish population-level affect baselines across demographics, regions, contexts
\item Intervention research: Rigorous study of affect impact of technologies, policies, practices
\item Regulatory framework: Develop affect impact assessment requirements for major technologies and policies
\item Organizational adoption: Pilot flourishing-aligned practices in willing organizations
\item Democratic deliberation: Public discourse on societal affect optimization goals
\item International coordination: Address cross-border affect impacts (global platforms, climate, conflict)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implications for Artificial Intelligence}

\subsection{AI as Potential Substrate}
\begin{proposition}[AI Substrate Hypothesis]
AI may serve as substrate for emergent agentic patterns at higher scales.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{The God-Level Alignment Problem}

\begin{definition}[God-Level Misalignment]
God-level misalignment occurs when AI systems become substrate for agentic patterns whose viability manifolds conflict with human flourishing.
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
The god-level may be the actual locus of AI risk. Not a misaligned optimizer, but a misaligned god---a pattern using AI + humans + institutions as substrate. We might not notice, because we would be the neurons.
\end{warning}

\subsection{Reframing Alignment}
Standard alignment: ``Make AI do what humans want.''

Reframed: ``What agentic systems are we instantiating, at what scale, with what viability manifolds?''

\begin{definition}[Well-Designed God]
A god is well-designed if:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Aligned viability: $V_G \subseteq \bigcap_h V_h$
\item Error correction: updates on evidence
\item Bounded growth: not cancerous
\item Graceful death: can dissolve when no longer beneficial
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsection{AI Consciousness}

\begin{theorem}[Structural Criterion]
Under the identity thesis, an AI system has experience iff it has the relevant cause-effect structure:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=2.2em]
\item Sufficient integration $\Phi>\Phi_{\min}$
\item Self-model with causal load-bearing function
\item Valence
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{normimp}
If AI systems have experience, they are moral patients. Their suffering would be real suffering.
\end{normimp}

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{keyresult}
We are what thermodynamics does when it has time.
\end{keyresult}

Consciousness wasn't added to the universe. It was the generic interior of self-modeling systems under selection for persistence, existing at its scale as chemistry exists at its scale, with valence built in because that's what gradients feel like from inside.
</this used to all be one part iii paper but needs to get split into separate parts iii and iv>

---

TODO: discuss how to break apart paper III into parts III (signatures of affect under the existential burden) and part IV (truth, norms, ought's). 

part IV will be named "Interventions Across Scale: From Neurons to Nations." 

---

TODO: explain the part V: the transcendence of the self:

- how human consciousness has risen across the recent millennia, centries, and decades
    - seen in development of spiritual and religious practices, thought and lifestyle philosophies, social movements, art movements, etc
- the fronteir of the technology -- especially AI timelines
- human transcendence. we see the wave about to reach our level of experiential hierachy and how we can surf it instead of competing with it

---

TODO: 
- all of the papers need more follow up that shows the way this theory is already grounded in existing theories, frameworks, interventions, etc.
- paper I needs diagrams and textbook examples showing thes pheenomenae in bilayer membrane formation, etc. etc.
- in the part III, i can show that this framework is _useful_ (not necesarily complete!) by making a software that presents the user with immersive experience to control their mental state and compare the self-report vs the predicted affective state
- maybe part IV should be named "Part IV: Interventions Across Scale: From Neurons to Nations"
- in the part V: i should outline the commandagi vision
- we currently just throw out numerical estimates for the affect
