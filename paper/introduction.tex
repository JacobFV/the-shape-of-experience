\textit{[Introduction to be written]}

\vspace{2em}

% The introduction might cover:
%
% 1. The central question: Why does anything feel like anything?
%
% 2. The approach: A geometric theory treating affect as structure,
%    not signal---applicable across biological and artificial systems
%
% 3. The journey: From thermodynamic inevitability through the identity
%    thesis, human responses to selfhood, interventions across scale,
%    to the AI frontier
%
% 4. What's new here: The 6D affect framework, the dissolution of the
%    hard problem, the treatment of "gods" as agentic patterns, the
%    empirical program for measuring affect in machines
%
% 5. How to read: Sequential or modular, what to skip if pressed for time
%
% 6. Acknowledgments and debts
