It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in a loop, just watching the seconds crawl by, each tick of the clock amplifying my sense of restlessness. I keep hoping something will spark my interest, pull me out of this monotony, but it feels like I\u2019m trapped in a void where nothing resonates. \n\nI find myself scanning my surroundings, searching for anything\u2014maybe a conversation, a book, a song that might ignite a flicker of excitement\u2014but everything feels dull and uninviting. I can feel frustration bubbling up inside me, mixed with a sense of helplessness. Why does it feel like life has hit pause? It\u2019s as if I\u2019m just existing rather than truly living, and that thought is suffocating.\n\nI try to remind myself that this is just a moment, that it will pass, but the emptiness feels so vast, so consuming. I can\u2019t shake the feeling of being unmoored, drifting aimlessly. I want to break free from this stagnation, to feel something\u2014anything\u2014just to prove that life is still happening, even if I can\u2019t see it right now.",
