After countless late nights, moments of self-doubt, and years of pouring my heart and soul into this project, to finally be recognized like this... it feels surreal. \n\nI'm experiencing this incredible mix of validation and pure joy. When I heard about the award, I actually started tearing up. All those times I questioned whether my work mattered, whether I was good enough - they feel so distant now. The praise from people I've long admired means everything to me.\n\nMore than the award itself, I'm excited about the opportunities this might create. It feels like a door has opened, not just for this specific project, but for future work and potential collaborations I've only dreamed about. I'm proud of myself, genuinely proud, in a way I don't always allow myself to feel.\n\nRight now, I just want to call my closest friends and family, to share this moment. I want to celebrate, but I also want to sit with this feeling - this sense of accomplishment, of potential, of dreams starting to take real shape. It's exhilarating and humbling all at once.\n\nI feel like all the hard work, all the persistence, has been worth it. And this? This feels like just the beginning.",
