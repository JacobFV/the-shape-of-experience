    "description": "An artificial system consists of 256 agents on a grid world. Each agent has an internal state (a vector of numbers) that updates based on what it observes in its local neighborhood. Agents move around, consume resources to maintain energy, and reproduce when they accumulate enough energy. Agents with zero energy are removed.\n\nDuring this observation period:\n- Population remained stable at 256 agents\n- This system has been running for many generations\n- The population has survived multiple periods of resource scarcity\n\nMeasured properties of agents' internal states:\n- Internal state update rate: 0.000 (higher = more rapid internal changes)\n- Prediction accuracy: 0.035044 mean squared error (lower = agents better at predicting their environment)\n- Information integration: 0.0769 (how much information is lost when the agents' internal states are analyzed in parts rather than as a whole; higher means the processing is more unified)\n- Integration under perturbation: 0.0735 (measured after randomly altering some inputs; increased relative to normal \u2014 perturbation makes processing MORE unified)\n",
